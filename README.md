# A simple Python package

I am trying to put together a minimal Python package that calls a library written in C that also depends on another library, FFTW.

I want to support different operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux), different processor architectures (x86, ARM), and users without the knowledge or tools to compile the library locally.

So far it is not working...
